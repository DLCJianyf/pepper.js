<h3>Browser Support</h3>
<h4>Chrome</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Chrome is currently the only platform that supports the NaCl and
  PNaCl examples.</li>
  <li>PNaCl requires Chrome 31 and above.</li>
  <li>To run the non-PNaCl NaCl examples, either enable NaCl in
  about:flags or pass --enable-nacl to Chrome on the command line.</li>
  <li>Note that "PNaCl Debug" examples are actually plain-old NaCl modules
  compiled using the PNaCl toolchain - no translation is being done in
  the browser.  Only "PNaCl Release" translates in the browser.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Firefox</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Firefox <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/">25 or later</a> is required.  The Web Audio API, etc, are only starting to be supported.</li>
  <li>Switching to fullscreen will unlock the mouse in Firefox.  Locking the mouse outside of fullscreen is only supported in nightly.</li>
  <li>Scaling 3D to fullscreen appears to be slow. Unscaled 3D seems to be fine.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Safari</h4>
<ul>
  <li>WebGL must be <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3300585">manually enabled</a> on Safari.</li>
  <li>Mouse lock is not supported in Safari.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Internet Explorer</h4>
<ul>
  <li>IE10 is partially supported - Graphics_3D, Audio, Fullscreen, and MouseLock APIs cannot be implemented.</li>
  <li>IE9 does not support typed arrays, which means that it cannot run code generated by Emscripten's asm.js backend.  It may be possible to use Emscripten's non-typed array code generation mode, but this has not been investigated (and will be slow).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Mobile</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Not yet tested.</li>
</ul>
